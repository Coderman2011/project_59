    <p id="para" > Mimicking,
imitate (someone or their actions or words),
especially to entertain or ridicule,
this can be also used as camouflage or distraction. I love mimicking as they are confusing to tell and makes us change tone in vocal tune using the neck position and the how the voice comes out. This makes it exiting to do. This also helps us communicate with animals with animal mimicry. though human mimicry is hard it is a little easier to do when you know animal mimicry,
sometimes the voice comes out automatically this is also one of the reasons I love mimicry,
it is hard for some person and others it is easy. mostly army people are trained to do this. Not mimicry but changing voice for a long time to deceive enemies. some birds can also change languages like a parrot talking in English from bird chirp. Synonyms of mimicry are imitations,
and impersonation. This is harmful in websites as they can cause frauds. So,
they can cause bad circumstances and even good.</p >
